        Their distinctly large ears help them to sense hidden predators. Their
        dark bodies blend into the shadows!.

      <p class="animal-description">
        The okapi may look like a zebra due to the stripes on its legs, but it
        is actually more closely related to the giraffe. Okapis belong to the
        family Giraffidae, and they are the only living relatives of giraffes.
        Unlike giraffes, okapis are shorter and adapted to life in dense
        rainforests.
